*prop-types - for passing props to components
*react-router-dom - for navigating to various pages in the web app

### `npm start` in the client directory

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.js` in the server directory
